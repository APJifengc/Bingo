    &c&l||&ea 5*5 task panel. You need to com-
    &c&l||&eplete the tasks inside as much as
    &c&l||&epossible. Each time you complete a
    &c&l||&etask, you will get a square of the
    &c&l||&epanel. If you can get 5 in a row
    &c&l||&eeither in a row, column, or diago-
    &c&l||&enal, you win!
